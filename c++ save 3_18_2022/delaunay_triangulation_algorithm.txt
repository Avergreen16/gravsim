make a line between each point, get the midpoint, and then create a circle centered on the midpoint that has a diameter
equal to the line between the points. Both points are on opposite sides of the circle's edge. If no points lie inside
the circle, the line connecting the 2 points is part of the Delaunay triangulation.
